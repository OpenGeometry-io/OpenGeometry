# AI-DOCs

Central location for documentation generated by AI agents (Codex, Copilot, etc.).

## What goes here

- design notes
- implementation logs
- testing/runbooks
- migration notes
- handoff summaries

## What does not go here

- source code
- compiled output/binaries
- user-facing product docs that belong elsewhere by explicit request

## Conventions

- Use `kebab-case` file names.
- Prefer focused docs over one large catch-all file.
- Include runnable commands and expected outputs when relevant.

## Recommended starter files

- `codex-repo-playbook.md`
- `local-testing-checklist.md`
- date-stamped implementation notes as needed

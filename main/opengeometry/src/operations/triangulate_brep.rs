// Refer to the BREP format we are using
// The BREP format is a way to represent 3D shapes using vertices, edges, and faces.
// This triangulation method will convert the BREP faces into a triangulated format along with Indices, Normals. UV would be added later.

// This is standalone triangulation function for BREP DS
